I have been a professional developer since the late 90's. My first paycheck was for creating a cgi/perl shopping cart for a computer shop in California. Since then I've put food on the table with the help of C/C++, VB-DOS, Visual Basic, Visual FoxPro, Java, Ruby, and PHP. (I'm not proud of my involvement with all the languages in that list, but I'll let you guess which ones.)

I don't understand internet memes and often wonder: Y U NO GET OFF MY LAWN.

I'm primarily responsible for hacking together various code, culminating in the very awesome *pixel8news.com*.

I'm married, with six children. I live in rural Utah with the aforementioned individuals, a dog, and approximately six hundred eighty-one cats (one of which recently had six kittens).

I'm more of a generalized geek than a "gaming geek" per se. Although I spend quite a generous portion of time gaming, it's primarily in a few games from a few genres.

You'll most often find me engaging dragons, spiders, or anything else Blizzard wants to digitize into a game. I don't often play games that aren't World of Warcraft, but when I do, I play ARPGs, shooters (ok, Borderlands, but I consider that a shooter), and I'm starting a stint with MOBAs (ok, MOBA because I doubt it will be plural).

My World of Warcraft /played time across most characters clocks in at a whopping 272d (6528h).

*[Editor's Note: He mistakenly deleted a few characters during a drunken Y2K binge in Zimbabawe--so you can probably safely add a few hundred hours to the previous total. Also Blizzard counts that in 24 hour days, folks, that's nearly a year of straight playing if he didn't need to eat, sleep, work, and say "Hi" to an occasional loved one or pet.]*

My alter-ego is named Tricorius. *[We are currently unsure of his stability, since he often answers to this name more quickly than his given name.]*

I expect that I will write infrequently, yet bitterly since that is what we curmudgeons do.
