Norm Johnson has been interested in computers and programming since he was very young.  He started messing around with code at the age of 13, but didn't get serious with it until he started his first developer position 5 years ago.

I love writing electronic music using Bigwig studio or whatever DAW I am learning at the moment.  I know most of the popular DAWS in and out.

Im a huge fan of Fantasy novels, Sci-Fi films, gangster films, and Rpgs.  RPGs are the genre that I just can't get away from.  I am always sinking  hours upon hours into the latest rpg whether it's a Japanese style rpg or a classic crpg style game.

Norm loves the gym, spending time with his beautiful wife, and dancing to electronic music at night clubs, raves, and festivals.

He also has exactly one Doge.  A Corgi named Odie.

[Editor's Note: Norm didn't like the robot that infultrated his brain when he wrote this up so he's currently rewriting it. We have it here for posterity.]
