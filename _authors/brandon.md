Introducing Brandon Beck

I have a small problem.  If you google "Brandon Beck" you don't get me.  You get the CEO and founder of Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends. He takes up like the first three pages of google search results.  That's ok though.  That guy is pretty cool.  He built a video game company, after all.  After that you've got doctors, some high school tennis player, and an IMDB entry for a guy who worked as an editor on "Keeping up with the Kardashians", and the list goes on for quite some time before you can find me.  This is unacceptable.  Seriously, Kardashians, other Brandon Beck?  I thought we were supposed to have standards.  In any case, its about time for me to make my small mark on the world.  I know the Video Game space already has a Brandon Beck, but that's what I love.

The original Nintendo Entertainment System was the first console my family had.  It was released the year before I was born, but playing the original Super Mario Bros. is the source of some of my first memories of gaming.  Then there was Duck Hunt, Contra and Blaster Master.  After that, I was hooked.  I just replayed through Super Mario Bros. last week.  I played without using any warp tubes, because I don't know that I've ever played through every level before then.  As a kid, my sister beat the game with her toes.  I'm still bragging about her to this day.

My parents bought a family computer with Windows 3.1.  We got by with some Qbasic games like nibbles (snake) or gorilla for a while, but it wasn't too long after that we had deleted Windows so that we had enough hard drive space to install Warcraft. Space was tight.  After that we installed Dune II.  I still have no idea what the first Dune game was. My family also ended up purchasing a Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and a PlayStation 1 and 2.  

You can't get me to shut up about the time I beat Wario's Stadium on Marko Kart 64 in under 20 seconds.  Yes, that is all 3 laps.  If you didn't already know, you can hop the wall at the beginning, and then hop right back behind the finish line. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soQCw2tpw7M">Here is a youtube video</a> of someone beating it slightly faster than I did. I still long for a moment like when I first saw the opening sequence of Final Fantasy VII.  I was convinced that graphics could never look better than that.  I also tend to brag a bit about the time I beat Final Fantasy VII in a single sitting.  26 hours straight.  I may need to rethink what is "cool".

I started a career as a web developer and have been writing code for the last 7 years.  I build my own gaming PCs. I have a binary clock from <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/59e0/?pfm=Search&t=led%20binary%20clock">Think Geek</a> on my desk at work.  
I married a beautiful gamer girl named Tiesha. She has put significantly more hours into World of Warcraft than I have. We love nothing more than staying in and gaming together, or at very least side by side.

All in all, I think its pretty clear that I'm a pretty geeky guy.  I hope that we can be geeky together and really have a lot of fun with this site.  I know that the community is going to really be the pillar that holds us up and makes us the best gaming website on the internet.  I look forward to getting to know you on here soon.
