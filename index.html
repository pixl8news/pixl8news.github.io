      <h1>Hi, we're pixel8news.</h1>
      <h2>We hunt down the best gaming news so you don't have to.</h2>
      <p>You work hard, you want to play hard (virtually, at least). Everyone wants a bit of your hard-earned cash. You just want to destroy some pixels. It's time-consuming to follow a bunch of blogs, try to filter out all the noise, and pick a few games that might meet your style. And that is assuming you don't get caught in a flame-war about why it was worth it to you to spend a grand on that sweet video card in your new rig.</p>
